# DrawLax

This repository is for a drawing application that runs on a local server using JavaScript(with React.js, Node.js and Vite), HTML + CSS. 

Here are some instructions for running this code. 
We're going to be using a command-line interface.
(I'm writing this from the perspective of a Mac user using Terminal (zsh). If you're a Windows user, you might use Powershell. If you use Visual Studio Code, you might find [this page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/javascript/nodejs-beginners-tutorial)
 helpful.)
### 1. [Clone this repo](https://github.com/cs160-su23/p4-creativity-canvas-gregoriiaaa) to your computer.
Once you've got it, [navigate to the directory](https://www.macworld.com/article/221277/command-line-navigating-files-folders-mac-terminal.html)
(ex: ``$ cd drawlax``)
### 2. [Make sure you have Node and npm installed.](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) 

Check to see if you can run  ``$ node -v`` and ``$ npm -v`` (My versions are v16.15.0 for node and 8.10.0 for npm.)
### 3. Install all the dependencies using npm. 
ex: ``$ npm install``
### 4. Run the app using npm:
ex: ``$ npm run dev``

You should see a message from Vite that says something like ``Local: http://localhost:5173``

### 5. View your website
Open a web browser (e.g. Google Chrome) to the URL Vite gave you: ``http://localhost:5173/``

You should see a delicious and fabulously designed drawing app! Nice!
